## Brief Descriptions of Analysis Scripts

# scATAC Analyses

scATAC_01 - Script for reading in 10x scATAC-seq fragments identify cells using number of fragments and TSS enrichment scores and saving fitlered fragments.

scATAC_02 - Script for pre-clustering using large windows genome-wide and then calling peaks on putative clusters and create a master peak set

scATAC_03 - LSI-Clustering + UMAP of scATAC-seq data with visualization and demonstration of how to properly save
umap for projection.

scATAC_04 - Computing Gene Activity Scores using an adapted form of Cicero (Pliner et al 2018).

scATAC_05 - Identifying potential disease cells by clustering disease w/ healthy reference, and then projecting these
cells onto healthy hematopoiesis.

# scRNA Analyses

scRNA_01 - LSI-Clustering + UMAP of scRNA-seq data with visualization and demonstration of how to properly save
umap for projection.

scRNA_02 - Identifying potential disease cells by clustering disease w/ healthy reference, and then projecting these
cells onto healthy hematopoiesis.
